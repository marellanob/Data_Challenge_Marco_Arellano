# DATA CHALLENGE - MARCO ARELLANO

This repository contains utility scripts and a Jupyter notebook for performing the clustering analysis required for the N1 Health data challenge. Additionally, you will find the datasets used for the project and the presentation in PDF format.

Please note that the utility scripts need to be in the same directory as the project for proper functionality.

Thank you!
